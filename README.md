# Machine-Learning-
Most of my practice machine learning codes that I have coded during my coursework.<br>
These codes follow concepts taught in the class.<br>
Please note the codes uploaded here are both in R and Python<br>

Common Libraries used in Python code are:<br>
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn

Common Libraries used in the R code:
- DPLYR
- TIDYR
- FORCATS
- GGPLOT2
- GLMNET

The codes in this section touch upon different concepts:
FDR(False Discovery Rate) 
Linear Regression
Binary Logistic Regression & Multinomial Logistic Regression
Regularization methods - Lasso and Ridge Regression
Experimentation - Treating for continuous treatment variables 
Using Double Lass to remove confounding effect
Principle Component Analysis(PCA) & PCR
AIC, BIC, AICc
RFECV, Random Forest
Bagging, Boosting Trees, etc.
