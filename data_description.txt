The income data is in a csv file. It is mostly clean data, but when data moves between systems, things like whitespaces that need to be trimmed might appear in the data
example : '<=50K' might become '  <=50K  '. Also, there may be nulls and empty cells. There are various common ways of solving such minor problems and it is good to make a habit of cleaning your data a little first.
Also, please refer to the arguments used in the data loading code in the shared python notebook.
